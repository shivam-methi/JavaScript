/*
Polymorphism::
1.  Ability to call the same method on different objects and each object responds in different way
2. can use the same method name repeatedly
3. achieved through the concept of method overloading and method overriding

Function Overloading - 
1. two or more functions can have the same name but different parameters
2. Function name should be the same and the arguments should be different.
3. JavaScript Does not support Function Overloading.

Function Overriding - 
1. Method belongs to the parent class can be override by the same method of child class
2. Optional - child class may or may not use the same logic implemented in the parent class method
3. In order to invoke the methods or properties of the base class, Super keyowrd is used
4. It's useful when we wants to alter the behaviour of any method of the parent class in child class.
