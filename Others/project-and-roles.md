## Role as QA:
- In my role as a QA for the OutreachCircle project, I handle both manual and automation testing to ensure 
  the platformâ€™s quality and reliability.

### Key Responsibilities:

### Requirement Analysis & Test Planning:
   - Review requirements, collaborate with stakeholders, and create detailed test plans and cases for both manual 
     and automated testing.

### Functional, Regression, and Exploratory Testing:
   - Execute manual testing for core functionalities, focusing on critical features like supporter actions, 
     data integrations, and dashboards.
   - Conduct regression tests to verify stability across releases and perform exploratory testing to uncover 
     hidden issues.

### Automation Framework Development:
   - Develop and maintain an automation framework using Javascript, Cypress for UI and API automation tools 
     for backend validation.
   - Automate high-priority, repetitive tests and integrate them into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure quick feedback 
     on every build.

### Bug Reporting and Collaboration:
   - Document and track bugs, providing clear steps and impact assessments, and work closely with developers to 
     ensure timely resolution.
  
### Continuous Improvement & Maintenance:
   - Regularly update and optimize both manual and automated test suites to adapt to changes, reduce execution time, 
     and improve test coverage.

- This combined approach enables me to ensure comprehensive testing coverage and maintain high-quality standards 
  across releases.
