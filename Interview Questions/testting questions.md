## Testing Questions:

### Q: how to test without acceptance criteria?
- Understand the Context:
  - In the absence of clear acceptance criteria, the first step is to gather as much information as possible. 
  - Start by reviewing related documentation like business requirements, user stories, or functional specifications.
  - Engage with stakeholders, including the product owner, developers, and end-users, to understand the functionality.
- Exploratory Testing:
  - Exploratory testing becomes crucial when there is a lack of formal documentation. 
  - This method allows testers to actively explore the application while simultaneously designing and executing tests. 
  - I would focus on understanding the core business logic and expected user behavior to uncover critical areas 
    of the application.
- Leverage Domain Knowledge:
  - Based on my knowledge of the domain or similar applications, I would identify key functionalities that are 
    likely to be important. This can help me create a mental model of what the application is supposed to do, and guide my testing efforts.
- Define Assumptions:
  - If acceptance criteria are not available, I would document assumptions on the expected behavior of the system. 
  - These assumptions could be based on past experiences or conversations with stakeholders. 
  - I’d ensure that these assumptions are communicated with the team to avoid any misunderstandings.
- Prioritize User Experience:
  - A lack of criteria might mean that there’s flexibility in how the feature is expected to behave. 
  - I would prioritize the end-user experience by testing various workflows and ensuring the application behaves in 
    a way that is intuitive and aligned with user expectations.
- Focus on Critical Areas: 
  - Without acceptance criteria, I would prioritize testing high-risk areas such as security, performance, and 
    data integrity. 
  - This can help ensure that key areas are functioning as expected.
- Regression Testing:
  - Since there’s no clear specification, it's important to ensure that new features or changes do not negatively 
    impact existing functionality. 
  - I would focus on regression testing to confirm that the rest of the application continues to perform as expected.
- Seek Clarification & Provide Feedback:
  - During the process, I would regularly communicate with stakeholders to validate any assumptions and clarify 
    any ambiguities. 
  - Once I’ve tested the feature, I can provide feedback on potential improvements or gaps in functionality.
