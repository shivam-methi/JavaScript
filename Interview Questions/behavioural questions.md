  everyone is aligned on the product’s requirements and quality expectations.
- Open communication is crucial for identifying potential issues early and ensuring that feedback is given in a 
  timely manner. 
- Collaboration is also key— QA should not operate in isolation. Instead, working as a part of a cross-functional team 
  ensures that quality is integrated throughout the entire development lifecycle.
- Additionally, a successful team embraces a continuous improvement mindset. This means being open to feedback, 
  learning from mistakes, and always looking for ways to improve processes — whether that’s through automation, 
  better test strategies, or enhancing workflows.

  and efficiency.
