## Javascript/Typescript Questions:

### Q: how do you utilize js in automation?
- JavaScript plays a crucial role in my test automation strategy, especially when working with tools and 
  frameworks designed for web applications.
- JavaScript allows me to create robust, scalable, and maintainable test automation scripts.
- Its flexibility, along with the power of modern testing frameworks, helps me ensure comprehensive testing for 
  web applications, APIs, and UI elements.
- Here’s how I utilize JavaScript in automation:
- Using JavaScript in Test Frameworks: 
  - I have experience with automation frameworks like Cypress and Protractor, 
    both of which use JavaScript as the core scripting language. 
  - These frameworks allow me to write end-to-end tests, interact with browser elements, 
    simulate user interactions, and validate DOM changes with ease.
- Browser Automation: 
  - When working with Cypress using Node.js, I use JavaScript to control browser interactions, 
    such as clicking buttons, filling forms, and verifying UI components. 
  - JavaScript’s asynchronous nature helps handle non-blocking operations, which is especially useful for 
    waiting for page loads or elements to appear.
- Custom Scripting: 
  - JavaScript allows me to create custom utility functions to interact with the application under test. 
  - For instance, I can write helper functions to parse complex JSON responses, validate dynamic content, 
    or handle asynchronous operations like waiting for elements or handling API calls.
- Integrating with CI/CD Pipelines: 
  - JavaScript-based test automation integrates seamlessly with Jenkins, GitLab, or other CI/CD pipelines. 
  - By utilizing npm scripts and test runners like Mocha or Jest, I can automate the execution of test cases as 
    part of the continuous testing process.
- API Testing with JavaScript: 
  - I also use JavaScript for API automation. 
  - In particular, I’ve used Postman and Insomnia to write JavaScript-based scripts for pre-request validations 
    and assertions in tests. 
  - This enables dynamic handling of API responses, as I can manipulate the data using JavaScript functions and logic.
