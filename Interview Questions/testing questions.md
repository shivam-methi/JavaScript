## Testing Questions:

### Q: how to test without acceptance criteria?
- #### Understand the Context:
  - In the absence of clear acceptance criteria, the first step is to gather as much information as possible. 
  - Start by reviewing related documentation like business requirements, user stories, or functional specifications.
  - Engage with stakeholders, including the product owner, developers, and end-users, to understand the functionality.
- #### Exploratory Testing:
  - Exploratory testing becomes crucial when there is a lack of formal documentation. 
  - This method allows testers to actively explore the application while simultaneously designing and executing tests. 
  - I would focus on understanding the core business logic and expected user behavior to uncover critical areas 
    of the application.
- #### Leverage Domain Knowledge:
  - Based on my knowledge of the domain or similar applications, I would identify key functionalities that are 
    likely to be important. This can help me create a mental model of what the application is supposed to do, and guide my testing efforts.
- #### Define Assumptions:
  - If acceptance criteria are not available, I would document assumptions on the expected behavior of the system. 
  - These assumptions could be based on past experiences or conversations with stakeholders. 
  - I’d ensure that these assumptions are communicated with the team to avoid any misunderstandings.
- #### Prioritize User Experience:
  - A lack of criteria might mean that there’s flexibility in how the feature is expected to behave. 
  - I would prioritize the end-user experience by testing various workflows and ensuring the application behaves in 
    a way that is intuitive and aligned with user expectations.
- #### Focus on Critical Areas: 
  - Without acceptance criteria, I would prioritize testing high-risk areas such as security, performance, and 
    data integrity. 
  - This can help ensure that key areas are functioning as expected.
- #### Regression Testing:
  - Since there’s no clear specification, it's important to ensure that new features or changes do not negatively 
    impact existing functionality. 
  - I would focus on regression testing to confirm that the rest of the application continues to perform as expected.
- #### Seek Clarification & Provide Feedback:
  - During the process, I would regularly communicate with stakeholders to validate any assumptions and clarify 
    any ambiguities. 
  - Once I’ve tested the feature, I can provide feedback on potential improvements or gaps in functionality.


### Q: what would be your Approach to execute 1000 test cases in short span of time?
- #### Prioritize Test Cases:
  - Start by identifying the high-risk and critical functionalities that must be tested. 
  - Test cases covering core features or areas with a high likelihood of defects should be prioritized.
  - Focus on test cases that directly affect business outcomes, ensuring the most important features are 
    validated first.
- #### Test Case Categorization:
  - Group the test cases into critical, high, medium, and low priority. 
  - Critical test cases should be executed first, followed by high-priority ones.
  - Some tests may be reusable across different features. Execute these first to save time.
- #### Automation:
  - If there are any test cases that can be automated, focus on automating repetitive, data-driven, or 
    regression test cases. 
  - This frees up time to focus on manual testing where it is truly necessary.
- #### Parallel Execution: 
  - Use test automation frameworks that support parallel execution to run multiple tests concurrently, 
    reducing overall execution time.
- #### Use of Efficient Test Execution Tools:
  - Use tools like TestRail or JIRA to organize, execute, and track progress efficiently. 
  - Such tools streamline test execution by offering dashboards and metrics to manage the test cases.
- #### Team Collaboration and Distribution:
  - Divide the test cases among the team based on their expertise. 
  - Assign the most skilled testers to the critical areas, ensuring those are handled with speed and accuracy.
  - In some cases, pair testers with developers or other QA engineers to quickly execute tests and resolve issues 
    on the spot.
- #### Smoke and Sanity Testing:
  - Before executing the entire suite, run a quick smoke test to ensure the basic functionalities are stable. 
  - This helps avoid spending time testing on unstable builds.
  - Perform sanity checks on new features or fixes to ensure they work as expected before diving into detailed 
    test cases.
- #### Time Management:
  - Allocate time for each group of test cases based on complexity and criticality. 
  - Avoid spending too much time on low-priority or non-critical areas when time is limited.
  - Continuously track the progress of test execution and adjust priorities if needed to ensure all high-priority 
    cases are covered within the available time.
- #### Regression Testing:
  - Focus on testing areas that are more likely to break with the new changes. 
  - Full regression may not be feasible in a short time, so use a risk-based approach to identify which regression 
    cases to run.
- #### Use Exploratory Testing for Quick Feedback:
  - If time is extremely limited, complement formal test case execution with exploratory testing. 
  - This allows testers to quickly identify defects without the need for a structured test case.
- #### Continuous Reporting and Stakeholder Communication:
  - Keep stakeholders informed about the progress, blockers, and any critical defects found. 
  - This helps in making informed decisions about extending time if needed.
