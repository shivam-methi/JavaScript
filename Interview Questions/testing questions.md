## Testing Questions:

### Q: how to test without acceptance criteria?
- #### Understand the Context:
  - In the absence of clear acceptance criteria, the first step is to gather as much information as possible. 
  - Start by reviewing related documentation like business requirements, user stories, or functional specifications.
  - Engage with stakeholders, including the product owner, developers, and end-users, to understand the functionality.
- #### Exploratory Testing:
  - Exploratory testing becomes crucial when there is a lack of formal documentation. 
  - This method allows testers to actively explore the application while simultaneously designing and executing tests. 
  - I would focus on understanding the core business logic and expected user behavior to uncover critical areas 
    of the application.
- #### Leverage Domain Knowledge:
  - Based on my knowledge of the domain or similar applications, I would identify key functionalities that are 
    likely to be important. This can help me create a mental model of what the application is supposed to do, and guide my testing efforts.
- #### Define Assumptions:
  - If acceptance criteria are not available, I would document assumptions on the expected behavior of the system. 
  - These assumptions could be based on past experiences or conversations with stakeholders. 
  - I’d ensure that these assumptions are communicated with the team to avoid any misunderstandings.
- #### Prioritize User Experience:
  - A lack of criteria might mean that there’s flexibility in how the feature is expected to behave. 
  - I would prioritize the end-user experience by testing various workflows and ensuring the application behaves in 
    a way that is intuitive and aligned with user expectations.
- #### Focus on Critical Areas: 
  - Without acceptance criteria, I would prioritize testing high-risk areas such as security, performance, and 
    data integrity. 
  - This can help ensure that key areas are functioning as expected.
- #### Regression Testing:
  - Since there’s no clear specification, it's important to ensure that new features or changes do not negatively 
    impact existing functionality. 
  - I would focus on regression testing to confirm that the rest of the application continues to perform as expected.
- #### Seek Clarification & Provide Feedback:
  - During the process, I would regularly communicate with stakeholders to validate any assumptions and clarify 
    any ambiguities. 
  - Once I’ve tested the feature, I can provide feedback on potential improvements or gaps in functionality.



### Q: what would be your Approach to execute 1000 test cases in short span of time?
- #### Prioritize Test Cases:
  - Start by identifying the high-risk and critical functionalities that must be tested. 
  - Test cases covering core features or areas with a high likelihood of defects should be prioritized.
  - Focus on test cases that directly affect business outcomes, ensuring the most important features are 
    validated first.
- #### Test Case Categorization:
  - Group the test cases into critical, high, medium, and low priority. 
  - Critical test cases should be executed first, followed by high-priority ones.
  - Some tests may be reusable across different features. Execute these first to save time.
- #### Automation:
  - If there are any test cases that can be automated, focus on automating repetitive, data-driven, or 
    regression test cases. 
  - This frees up time to focus on manual testing where it is truly necessary.
- #### Parallel Execution: 
  - Use test automation frameworks that support parallel execution to run multiple tests concurrently, 
    reducing overall execution time.
- #### Use of Efficient Test Execution Tools:
  - Use tools like TestRail or JIRA to organize, execute, and track progress efficiently. 
  - Such tools streamline test execution by offering dashboards and metrics to manage the test cases.
- #### Team Collaboration and Distribution:
  - Divide the test cases among the team based on their expertise. 
  - Assign the most skilled testers to the critical areas, ensuring those are handled with speed and accuracy.
  - In some cases, pair testers with developers or other QA engineers to quickly execute tests and resolve issues 
    on the spot.
- #### Smoke and Sanity Testing:
  - Before executing the entire suite, run a quick smoke test to ensure the basic functionalities are stable. 
  - This helps avoid spending time testing on unstable builds.
  - Perform sanity checks on new features or fixes to ensure they work as expected before diving into detailed 
    test cases.
- #### Time Management:
  - Allocate time for each group of test cases based on complexity and criticality. 
  - Avoid spending too much time on low-priority or non-critical areas when time is limited.
  - Continuously track the progress of test execution and adjust priorities if needed to ensure all high-priority 
    cases are covered within the available time.
- #### Regression Testing:
  - Focus on testing areas that are more likely to break with the new changes. 
  - Full regression may not be feasible in a short time, so use a risk-based approach to identify which regression 
    cases to run.
- #### Use Exploratory Testing for Quick Feedback:
  - If time is extremely limited, complement formal test case execution with exploratory testing. 
  - This allows testers to quickly identify defects without the need for a structured test case.
- #### Continuous Reporting and Stakeholder Communication:
  - Keep stakeholders informed about the progress, blockers, and any critical defects found. 
  - This helps in making informed decisions about extending time if needed.



### Q: what will be your approach if you found a major bug before release?
- #### Immediate Bug Reporting:
  - First, I would immediately log the bug in the defect tracking tool (e.g., JIRA), ensuring that I provide 
    detailed information, including steps to reproduce, screenshots, logs, and any other relevant data 
    that can help developers diagnose the issue quickly.
  - Since it’s a major bug, I would categorize it appropriately, marking it as "Critical" or "Blocker" so that 
    the development team understands the urgency and impact.
- #### Assess the Impact:
  - I would assess how the bug affects the core functionality, user experience, or business impact. 
  - Does the bug cause a crash, data loss, or compromise security? Understanding the severity and scope is essential 
    to communicate effectively with stakeholders.
  - If possible, I would investigate whether there are any temporary workarounds that could mitigate the issue and 
    help users continue using the application without critical problems.
- #### Communicate with Stakeholders:
  - I would promptly inform key stakeholders, including the product owner, development team, and project manager, 
    about the bug and its potential impact on the release. 
  - Clear communication is vital to ensure that all parties understand the risks.
- #### Collaborate with Development Team:
  - I would collaborate with the development team to determine how quickly the bug can be resolved. 
  - Depending on the nature of the bug, we would discuss whether it's feasible to fix it immediately, apply a 
    patch post-release, or defer the release.
  - If a fix is possible, we would assess the risks involved in implementing a last-minute change. 
  - I’d also consider the time required for retesting and ensure there’s no negative impact on other functionalities.
- #### Retesting After Fix:
  - Once the bug is fixed, I would prioritize testing the fix thoroughly and perform a quick round of regression 
    testing to ensure the fix hasn’t introduced any new issues, especially in critical areas.
  - If time is limited, I would focus on the areas related to the bug fix and its dependencies, minimizing the risk
    of regression while still delivering quality.
- #### Release Decision:
  - I would participate in the discussion with stakeholders on whether the release should be delayed. 
  - If the bug significantly impacts key functionalities or user experience, delaying the release might be the 
    best option.
  - If the bug is non-critical or has a workaround, and the release cannot be delayed, I would ensure that the 
    team is prepared to release a hotfix or patch immediately after release.
- #### Post-Release Monitoring:
  - If the decision is made to release with the bug, I would ensure that we closely monitor the application 
    post-release for any user-reported issues or incidents, with a plan for quickly addressing the bug.
- #### Document Lessons Learned:
  - After the issue is resolved, I would participate in a retrospective to analyze why the bug was not caught earlier,
    how we could improve our process, and whether adjustments to our test strategy, communication, or tooling are needed to prevent such situations in the future.



### Q: how do you provide estimates to user stories as a QA?
- #### Understand the User Story:
  - The first step is to thoroughly review the user story and clarify any ambiguities with the product owner or 
    business analyst. 
  - I need to fully understand the scope, acceptance criteria, and any edge cases before providing an estimate.
  - Large user stories, or "epics," should be broken down into smaller, testable components. This makes it easier 
    to provide more accurate estimates for each part.
- #### Identify Testing Scope:
  - Identify what functionality needs to be tested and whether the story introduces new features, changes to 
    existing features, or fixes.
  - Determine whether the story requires non-functional testing, such as performance, security, or usability tests.
  - Assess the potential impact of the story on existing features. 
- #### Estimate Based on Complexity:
  - Consider whether the setup of specific environments, configurations, or test data is needed before testing 
    can begin.
  - I would assess the complexity of the story by considering the number of scenarios, edge cases, and any 
    dependencies on other systems or components.
  - Higher-risk stories, such as those impacting critical or unstable areas of the product, may require additional 
    time for more thorough testing.
- #### Breakdown of QA Activities: 
  - I would break down the tasks involved in testing the user story to provide a detailed estimate.
  - Time required to write and review test cases based on acceptance criteria.
  - Estimate how long it will take to execute both manual and automated tests.
  - Include time for logging, tracking, and verifying bug fixes.
  - If necessary, account for additional exploratory testing to cover unanticipated issues.
- #### Consider Test Automation:
  - If the story requires automated tests, I would factor in time for writing and maintaining test scripts. 
  - Automation usually takes longer initially but speeds up future regression testing.
- #### Collaboration with Team:
  - If the user story has dependencies on development, design, or third-party systems, I would account for 
    the coordination effort and potential delays.
  - Participating in team estimation sessions (e.g., sprint planning or backlog refinement) ensures that I align 
    my estimates with the development team. 
- #### Buffer for Uncertainty:
  - I would include a small buffer in my estimate to account for unexpected issues such as environment instability, 
    ambiguous requirements, or last-minute changes.
- #### Use Historical Data:
  - I would refer to similar user stories or past sprints to guide my estimation. 
  - Historical data can help in understanding typical time frames for testing similar features.
- #### Provide Final Estimate:
  - Based on the complexity and effort required, I would provide a time estimate (in hours or days). 
  - Typically, story points are used in Agile teams to reflect effort, while time estimates can be used when 
    more detailed planning is required.
- #### Continuous Review and Adjustment:
  - After providing an initial estimate, I would continuously review the actual progress during the sprint and 
    adjust if any significant blockers or scope changes arise.
