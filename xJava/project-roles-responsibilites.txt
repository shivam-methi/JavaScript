Project: 
- Upwork Enterprises is a global freelancing platform that connects businesses and independent professionals 
  from around the world. 
- Upwork allows businesses to post job listings, and freelancers can bid on these jobs to offer their services. 
- The platform enables collaboration across various industries, including software development, design, 
   writing, marketing, and more. 
- The project is focused on building and maintaining features that support these collaborations, 
  enabling businesses and freelancers to interact seamlessly.
- So there are different components & modules which they provides and we need to verify frontend and backend for the same.


Roles and Responsibilites: 

1. Develop and maintain robust automation frameworks for functional, regression, and end-to-end testing 
   using Java, Selenium, and Rest Assured:
- For UI automation, we used Selenium with a Page Object Model (POM) design pattern to maintain clear separation 
  between the UI structure and test logic.
- This structure made the framework highly maintainable and reusable across different modules. 
- The framework supported functional, regression, and end-to-end testing, allowing us to quickly 
  validate different workflows in the application.
- we Write BDD scenarios in Gherkin syntax and implement step definitions using Cucumber for better 
  collaboration and test clarity
- The framework also supported data-driven testing by externalizing test data through files like Excel or JSON, 
  enhancing its flexibility and scalability for multiple test scenarios.


2. Automate API testing using Rest Assured to ensure coverage of RESTful web services and 
   integrate scripts with CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub CI):
- For API testing, I automated the testing of RESTful services using Rest Assured. 
- This involved creating reusable methods for common API operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and 
  validating the response structure, status codes, and data integrity.
- I also implemented JSON schema validation to ensure that API responses followed the expected structure 
  and contained the correct data.
- The API automation suite was integrated into the CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins and GitHub CI, 
  allows the tests to be triggered automatically after each deployment. 
  This ensured that any API-related issues were identified early in the development cycle.


3. validate application functionality, usability, and performance, identifying and reporting defects promptly


4. Perform sanity and regression testing post-deployment to ensure bug fixes and application stability, 
   along with weekly production sanity checks and reporting
