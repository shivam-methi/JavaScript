Pojo in RestAssured:

- In Rest Assured, you can use POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects) to handle request and response bodies 
  for easy serialization and deserialization of JSON or XML. 
- This approach allows you to map JSON or XML objects to Java classes
- makes it easier to manage the structure and content of your API requests and responses.
-  Using POJOs improves code readability, allows for type safety, and reduces the need for 
   hardcoded JSON strings.


Steps to Use POJO in Rest Assured:

1. Create a POJO Class: Define a POJO class with the necessary fields that match the structure 
                        of the JSON/XML body.
2. Serialization: Convert (serialize) a POJO to JSON/XML when sending data in a request body.
3. Deserialization: Convert (deserialize) a JSON/XML response body into a POJO.


Serialization/Deserialization Libraries:
- By default, Rest Assured uses the following libraries for serialization/deserialization:
    Jackson (for JSON)
    JAXB (for XML)
