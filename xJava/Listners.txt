Listeners in TestNG:
- TestNG listeners are interfaces that allow you to monitor test events such as the start, success, failure, 
  or completion of test cases. 
- You can implement these listeners to customize the test flow and take certain actions when these events occur.

 Types of Listeners:
 
1. ITestListener: Listens to test execution events like start, success, failure, or skipping of tests.
2. IAnnotationTransformer: Modifies the annotations at runtime before the test execution begins.
3. ISuiteListener: Listens to events at the suite level (before and after the entire test suite is executed).
4. IInvokedMethodListener: Monitors the invocation of test methods, including configuration methods.
5. IReporter: Generates a custom report once the tests have finished executing.
6. IExecutionListener: Notifies when the execution starts or finishes.
