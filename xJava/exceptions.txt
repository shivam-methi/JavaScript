1. NoSuchElementException:
- This occurs when the WebDriver is unable to locate the element using the given selector (e.g., XPath, CSS, ID).


2. StaleElementReferenceException:
- This occurs when an element that was previously found becomes stale, 
  meaning it is no longer attached to the DOM.
- This often happens after a page refresh or DOM update.


3. TimeoutException: 
- This exception is thrown when an operation (e.g., locating an element, loading a page) 
  takes longer than the specified time limit.


4. ElementNotVisibleException:
- This occurs when the element is present in the DOM but is not visible, 
  and Selenium is trying to interact with it (e.g., clicking or sending text).


5. ElementNotInteractableException: 
-  This exception is thrown when the element is visible but not interactable 
   (e.g., a disabled input field, or covered by another element).


6. NoSuchFrameException:
- This exception is thrown when trying to switch to a frame that doesnâ€™t exist.


7. NoAlertPresentException:
- This exception occurs when Selenium tries to switch to an alert box but no alert is currently 
  present on the page.


8. WebDriverException:
- This is a generic exception thrown by WebDriver when something goes wrong during command execution. 
- This can happen due to various reasons, such as browser not responding, session crashes, or 
  incorrect driver configurations.
