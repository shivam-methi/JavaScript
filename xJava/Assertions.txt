Types of Assertions:

1. Hard Assertions: 
- If the assertion fails, the test execution is aborted, and no further steps are executed.
import org.testng.Assert;
assertEquals(): Checks if two values are equal.
assertTrue(): Checks if a condition is true.
assertFalse(): Checks if a condition is false.
assertNull(): Checks if an object is null.
assertNotNull(): Checks if an object is not null.
assertSame(): Checks if two objects refer to the same object.
assertNotSame(): Checks if two objects do not refer to the same object.


2. Soft Assertions: 
- The test continues even if an assertion fails. 
All failures are reported at the end of the test execution.
import org.testng.asserts.SoftAssert;
softAssert.assertAll();
