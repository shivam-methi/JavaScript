Annotations:
- Annotations in testing frameworks like TestNG are special forms of metadata that provide information 
  about how to execute tests.
- They are used to define specific behaviors for test methods, such as setup and teardown operations, 
  test configuration.


1. @Test:
- This annotation is used to define a test case in TestNG.
- It can also be configured with parameters like priority, dependsOnMethods, groups, etc.
  priority: Defines the order in which tests should be executed.
  dependsOnMethods: Specifies that a test depends on the successful execution of another test.
  enabled: Allows you to disable a test.


2. @BeforeMethod:
- Runs before each test method. It's commonly used to set up the test environment, 
  such as opening a browser or initializing test data.
- Typically used to execute setup operations before each test case.


3. @AfterMethod:
- Runs after each test method. It is used to clean up resources, such as closing the browser 
  or clearing session data.
- Commonly used for teardown or cleanup after each test case.


4. @BeforeClass:
- Runs before the first test method in the current class. 
- It’s usually used for tasks that need to be executed once for the entire class, 
  like initializing shared resources.
- Set up resources that are shared among all tests in a class.


5. @AfterClass:
- Runs after all the test methods in the current class have been executed. 
- This is typically used to release shared resources.
- Clean up operations for resources initialized in the @BeforeClass method.


6. @BeforeSuite:
- Runs before the execution of all tests in the current suite. 
- It’s often used for global setup tasks like configuring the test environment or 
  initializing external services.
- Typically used for suite-wide setup operations.


7. @AfterSuite:
- Runs after the execution of all tests in the current suite. 
- It’s used for global cleanup tasks, such as closing external connections or generating reports.
- Used for suite-wide teardown operations.


8. @DataProvider:
- Used to supply test data to a test method. 
- It allows for data-driven testing by passing multiple sets of data to the same test method.
- Useful for testing with different input values in the same test case.


9. @Parameters:
- Used to pass parameters from the testng.xml file to test methods. 
- It allows for parameterized testing where the values are specified externally.
- For running tests with different sets of parameters specified in the XML configuration.
