## Operators:
- Operators are special symbols or keywords that perform operations on operands (values or variables).

### Assignment Operator:
- =: Assigns a value to a variable 
    (e.g., x = 5, let x = y = 1;)

- +=: Adds and assigns 
    (e.g., x += 3 is equivalent to x = x + 3)

- -=: Subtracts and assigns 
    (e.g., x -= 3 is equivalent to x = x - 3)

- *=: Multiplies and assigns 
    (e.g., x *= 3 is equivalent to x = x * 3)

- /=: Divides and assigns 
    (e.g., x /= 3 is equivalent to x = x / 3)

- %=: Modulus and assigns 
    (e.g., x %= 3 is equivalent to x = x % 3)
