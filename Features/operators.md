## Operators:
- Operators are special symbols or keywords that perform operations on operands (values or variables).

### Assignment Operator:
- `=`: Assigns a value to a variable 
       (e.g., x = 5, let x = y = 1;)

- `+=`: Adds and assigns 
        (e.g., x += 3 is equivalent to x = x + 3)

- `-=`: Subtracts and assigns 
        (e.g., x -= 3 is equivalent to x = x - 3)

- `*=`: Multiplies and assigns 
        (e.g., x *= 3 is equivalent to x = x * 3)

- `/=`: Divides and assigns 
        (e.g., x /= 3 is equivalent to x = x / 3)

- `%=`: Modulus and assigns 
        (e.g., x %= 3 is equivalent to x = x % 3)


### Arithmetic Operator:
- `+`: Addition 
       (e.g., 5 + 3 returns 8)

- `-`: Subtraction 
       (e.g., 5 - 3 returns 2)

- `*`: Multiplication 
       (e.g., 5 * 3 returns 15)

- `/`: Division 
       (e.g., 6 / 3 returns 2)

- `%`: Modulus (remainder) 
       (e.g., 5 % 2 returns 1)

- `++`: Increment 
        (e.g., let x = 5; x++ increments x to 6)

- `--`: Decrement 
        (e.g., let x = 5; x-- decrements x to 4)
