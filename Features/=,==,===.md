## JavaScript Operators

### (=) Assignment Operator 

- = represents the assignment operator.
- Used to assign values to variables.

```javascript
let x = 5; 
console.log(x); // Assigns the value 5 to the variable x
```

### (==) Equality Operator::
- == represents to equality operator
- it compares the value on both sides (left & right) and return true if they are equal
- it checks for value equality but ignores the type.

```javascript
let a = 5;
let b = "5";
console.log(a == b); // true, because the string "5" is converted to the number 5 before comparison
```


### (===) Strict Equality Operator::
- === represents to strict equality operator
- it compares the values on both sides (left & right) along with their data types
- and return true if they are equal
- It ensures that both the value and the type are the same.

```javascript
let c = 5;
let d = "5";
console.log(c === d); // false, because the types (number and string) are different
```
