#### (=) Assignment Operator::
##### ● = represents to assignment operator 
##### ● use to  assign values to a variables

```bash
let x = 5; 
console.log(x); // Assigns the value 5 to the variable x
```


#### (==) Equality Operator::
##### ● == represents to equality operator 
##### ● it compares the value on both sides (left & right) and return true if they are equal
##### ● it checks for value equality but ignores the type.

```bash
let a = 5;
let b = "5";
console.log(a == b); // true, because the string "5" is converted to the number 5 before comparison
```


#### (===) Strict Equality Operator::
##### ● === represents to strict equality operator
##### ● it compares the values on both sides (left & right) along with their data types 
#####    and return true if they are equal
##### ● It ensures that both the value and the type are the same.

```bash
let c = 5;
let d = "5";
console.log(c === d); // false, because the types (number and string) are different
```
