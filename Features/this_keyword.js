/*
this keyword::
1. 'this' always refers to an object
2. reference will vary depending on how and where 'this' is being called
3. 'this' is not a variable â€“ it's a keyword, so its value can't be changed or reassigned
4. If we call 'this' by itself, not within a function or object, it will refer to the global window object
5. we can use 'this' to access properties and methods from the same object
