| Code Structure | Nesting of functions             | Flat structure with chaining  | Flat structure, sequential flow|

| Chaining       | Complex and can lead             | Chained with multiple         | sequential flow with `await`   | 
|                | to callback hell                 | `.then()` calls               |                                |

| Debugging      | Harder to debug                  | Easier than callbacks         | Easiest to debug due to        |
